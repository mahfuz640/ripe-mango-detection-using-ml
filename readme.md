# 🥭 Mango Ripeness Detection using Machine Learning (Tkinter GUI)

Have you ever wondered how to choose the **perfect mango**?

This project applies **Machine Learning** in agriculture to automatically detect the **ripeness stage of mangoes** — whether *unripe*, *ripe*, or *overripe* — using image classification via a simple and interactive **Tkinter GUI**.

This helps in:
- ✅ Better fruit selection
- 📦 Enhancing the agricultural supply chain
- ♻️ Reducing food waste
- 🥗 Ensuring top-quality produce reaches your table

---

## 🖥️ GUI Application using Tkinter

A user-friendly desktop interface built with Python's `Tkinter`, allowing users to:
- Upload mango images
- View prediction results instantly
- See the image preview and ripeness label

---

## 🧠 ML Model

- Type: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Framework: PyTorch
- Training done using labeled mango dataset with three classes:
  - Unripe
  - Ripe
  - Overripe

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- PyTorch
- Tkinter
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- OpenCV (for image preprocessing)

## 🔮 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mango-ripeness-tkinter.git
    cd mango-ripeness-tkinter
    ```

2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python gui_app_tkinter.py
    ```

## 🌱 Future Improvements

- Enhance UI with more features (e.g., drag & drop)
- Add webcam support for real-time classification
- Extend to other fruits or vegetables
